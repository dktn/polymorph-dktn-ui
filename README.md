# polymorph-ui package

A shapeshifting interface! The UI adapts to your current syntax. It began as an experiment within graphite-ui, but I chose to make a different package for it.

### Features

* Flexible UI - The UI will search for colors within "syntax-variables.less", it will then use these colors to calculate the UI colors.
* Works with light and dark syntax colors.
